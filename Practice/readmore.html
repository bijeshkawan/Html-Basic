        According to World Health Organisation, smoking is responsible for the deaths of approximately five million people each year. Despite knowing the health hazards of smoking, quitting smoking can be really tough for smokers. According to the National Institute of  Health, about 40%  of smokers who want to quit smoking makes a serious attempt  to do so each year, but less than 5% succeed because of the highly addictive properties of nicotine.<br>

Cigarettes contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance found naturally in tobacco. It stimulates pleasure centres in the brain and is highly addictive. Smokers experience physical withdrawal symptoms, compelling the person want to start smoking again to get rid of withdrawal symptoms when nicotine is discontinued.

Quitting smoking will improve the quality and length of life and lives of people living around. One will need to change behaviour and cope with nicotine withdrawal symptoms to quit smoking successfully. Furthermore, one should also need to find healthier ways to manage moods.
<br>
Here are few ways that will help you quit smoking.
<br>
Nicotine replacement therapy

Nicotine replacement therapy is the most commonly used method to quit smoking. Many studies have shown that nicotine replacement therapy is safe and effective. Nicotine replacement may be applying nicotine patch, lozenges, gum, nasal spray or any other form of nicotine therapy. Many smokers find it useful when they use some sort of nicotine therapy rather than other means.

This therapy lessens withdrawal symptoms by providing you a small amount of nicotine but noone of the other dangerous chemicals found in cigarettes. This small amount of nicotine helps you satisfy craving for nicotine and reduces urges to smoke.
<br>
Avoid triggers

Urges for tobacco are strongest in the situations, such as at parties or bars, or while you are stressed or sipping coffee. Identify your triggers and plan to avoid them entirely and get through them without using tobacco. For instance, if you usually smoke while you talk on your phone, keep a pen and paper nearby to occupy yourself with doodling rather than smoking. If you would smoke on your lunch time, then keep yourself engaged in other activities that will distract you.

Chew something

Keep your mouth busy to fight a tobacco craving. Chew on sugarless gum or hard candy or raw carrots which is crunchy and satisfying.

Do not have ‘ just one’

You might be tempted to have just one cigarette to satisfy a tobacco craving. But do not fool yourself into believing that you can stop there. Smoking just one will lead to another and eventually you may end up starting to consume tobacco again.

Relaxation techniques

Many people are more likely to smoke when they are stressed. Resisting tobacco craving may be a stressful situation to someone who is trying to quit smoking. Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, muscle relaxation, yoga, massage and listening to calm music may help.

Physical activity

Physical activity can help you distract from tobacco cravings and also reduce intensity. Exercise such as, running up and down the stairs a few times can make your tobacco craving go away. You can also go out for a walk or jog. When you are at home of office, try squats, deep knee bends, push ups.

Maintain a healthy diet

Eat plenty of fresh, crunchy fruits and vegetables. This may be a useful way of satisfying oral cravings without adding calories. Drink plenty of fluids. Consumption of moderate amount of coffee or tea may be helpful as it have antidepressant properties.
<br>
Change daily habits

If you smoke after eating, replace it with other activities, such as playing a tape or CD, eating a piece of fruit. In addition, change your daily schedule, particularly eating times, as much as possible. Eat at different times or eat small meals frequently instead of  large ones.

Set a short term quitting goals and reward yourself when they are fulfilled. Put the money normally spent on cigarettes in a jar and buy something pleasurable at the end of a predetermined period of time.</p></body>
